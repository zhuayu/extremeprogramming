<!-- The Customer is Always Available -->
# 客户紧密协作

<!-- One of the few requirements of extreme programming (XP) is to have the customer available. Not only to help the development team, but to be a part of it as well. All phases of an XP project require communication with the customer, preferably face to face, on site. It's best to simply assign one or more customers to the development team. Beware though, this seems like a long time to keep the customer hanging and the customer's department is liable to try passing off a trainee as an expert. You need the expert. -->
极限编程（XP）要求有客户参与，并非仅仅为了帮助开发团队，而是使其成为开发团队的一份子。XP的所有阶段均要求与客户进行沟通，最好是在现场面对面沟通。能够直接分配一到多个客户人员给开发团队效果最佳。但是请注意，这看起来会占用客户大量的时间，以至于有些客户会用新手来冒充专家，你需要真正的专家！

<!-- User Stories are written by the customer, with developers helping, to allow time estimates, and assign priority. The customers help make sure most of the system's desired functionality is covered by stories. -->
[用户故事](user-story.md)由客户在开发人员的帮助下编写，可估算时间并分配优先级。客户可以帮助确保故事涵盖了系统所需的大多数功能。

<!-- During the release planning meeting the customer will need to negotiate a selection of user	stories to be included in each scheduled release. The timing of the release may need to be negotiated as well. The customers must make the decisions that affect their business goals. A release planning meeting is used to define small incremental releases to allow functionality to be released to the customer early. This allows the customers to try the system earlier and give the developers feedback sooner. -->
在[发布计划会议](release-planning.md)期间，需要同客户一起协商出每一次发布所要包含的用户故事，同时也要协商出发布的具体时间表。那些能够影响商业目标的决策必须由客户来做。发布计划会议通过定义[小批量增量发布](small-release.md)来尽早为客户交付功能，这使客户可以更早试用系统并及时为团队提供反馈。

<!-- Because details are left off the user stories the developers will need to talk with customers to get enough detail to complete a programming task. Projects of any significant size will require a full time commitment from the customer. -->
由于用户故事缺少细节，开发人员需要与客户沟通以获得足够的细节来完成[编程任务](iteration-plan.md)。任何有一定规模的项目都需要客户的全情投入。

<!-- The customer will also be needed to help with functional testing. The test data will need to be created and target results computed or verified. Functional tests verify that the system is ready to be released into production. It can happen that the system will not pass all functional tests just prior to release. The customer will be needed to review the test score and allow the system to continue into production or stop it. -->
在[功能测试](acceptance-test.md)期间也需要客户的介入，以帮助团队准备测试数据并验证计算结果。功能测试确保系统在发布到生产环境前已准备妥当。可能会有在发布前系统任然无法通过所有功能性测试的情况，此时需要客户来评估测试结果，并决定是继续发布还是立即终止。

<!-- This may seem like a lot of the customer's time at first but we should remember that the customer's time is spared initially by not requiring a detailed requirements specification and saved later by not delivering an uncooperative system. Some problems can occur when multiple customers are made available part time. Experts in any field have a tendency to argue. This is natural. Solve this problem by requiring all the customers to be available for occasional group meetings to hash out differences of opinion. -->
这看起来会耗费客户大量的时间，但我们需要牢记的是，前期因为没有事无巨细的需求规格说明书而花费客户的大量时间，后期却因为交付了真正可用的系统为客户节省了大量的时间。当有多名客户人员兼职参与团队活动时，可能会发生一些问题。领域专家们的意见不一致，会很常见。有效解决此类问题的方式就是定期召开小组会来解决分歧。
