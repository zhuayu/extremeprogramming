Fix XP When It Breaks

Fix the process when it breaks. I don't say if because I already know you will need to make some changes for your specific project. Follow the XP Rules to start with, but do not hesitate to change what doesn't work. This doesn't mean the team can do whatever they want. The rules must be followed until the team has changed them. All of your developers must know exactly what to expect from each other, having a set of rules is the only way to set these expectations.
Have retrospective meetings to talk about what is working and what is not and devise ways to improve XP. Make improving your process a normal part of your development.
