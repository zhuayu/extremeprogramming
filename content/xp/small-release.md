# 小步发布

开发团队需要频繁地、迭代地向客户交付可用的系统版本。有些团队能够每日部署软件新版本至生产环境。如果做不到每日发布，则至少需要每周、最多每两周完成软件新版本的部署发布。在每个迭代周期之后，都应该有经过测试的、可工作的、可随时发布的软件版本向客户进行演示。最终是否发布至生产环境则由客户来决定。

极限编程团队把具有重要业务意义的功能拆分成小的单元（即[用户故事](user-story.md)），在[发布计划会议](release-planning.md)上安排各个功能单元的交付计划，并尽早将其发布至客户的生产环境。小步发布有助于及时获取有价值的反馈，从而对系统开发产生有效的影响。重要的功能特性越晚让使用者看到，应对缺陷、用户不满和需求变化的时间就越少。

# Make frequent small releases
 
The development team needs to release iterative versions of the system to the customers often. Some teams deploy new software into production every day. At the very least you will want to get new software into production every week or two. At the end of every iteration you will have tested, working, production ready software to demonstrate to your customers. The decision to put it into production is theirs.

The release planning meeting is used to plan small units of functionality that make good business sense and can be released into the customer's environment early in the project. This is critical to getting valuable feedback in time to have an impact on the system's development. The longer you wait to introduce an important feature to the system's users the less time you will have to fix it.
