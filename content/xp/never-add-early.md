<!-- Never Add Functionality Early. -->

# 不要过早添加功能


<!-- Keep the system uncluttered with extra stuff you guess will be used later. Only 10% of that extra stuff will ever get used, so you are wasting 90% of your time. We are all tempted to add functionality now rather than later because we see exactly how to add it or because it would make the system so much better. It seems like it would be faster to add it now. But we need to constantly remind our selves that we are not going to actually need it. Extra functionality will always slow us down and squander our resources. -->
 
<!-- Keeping your code ready for unexpected changes is about simple design. Adding extra flexibility beyond what you need now always makes a design more complex. -->
 
<!-- Turn a blind eye towards future requirements and extra flexibility. Concentrate on what is scheduled for today only. XP Rules -->
