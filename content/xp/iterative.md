# 迭代式开发

<!-- Iterative Development adds agility to the development process. Divide your development schedule into about a dozen iterations of 1 to 3 weeks in length. One week is the best choice even though it seems very short. Keep the iteration length constant through out the project. This is the heart beat of your project. It is this constant that makes measuring progress and planning simple and reliable in XP. -->

迭代式开发提升了软件开发过程的敏捷性。将开发计划拆分成固定长度为1~3周的迭代，1周虽然很短，但却是最佳选择。在整个项目周期内保持迭代长度不变，这是项目的心跳，也正是因为这种一致，才使得XP中的[度量](introduction.md)和计划变得简单可靠。

<!-- Don't schedule your programming tasks in advance. Instead have an iteration planning meeting at the beginning of each iteration to plan out what will be done. Just-in-time planning is an easy way to stay on top of changing user requirements. -->

不要提前安排开发任务，取而代之应该在每次迭代的开始，通过召开[迭代计划会议](iteration-plan.md)来确定当次迭代要完成的内容。即时计划是一种应对需求频繁变化的简单手段。

<!-- It is also against the rules to look ahead and try to implement anything that it is not scheduled for this iteration. There will be plenty of time to implement that functionality when it becomes the most important story in the release plan. -->

[试图提前实现](never-add-early.md)当前迭代以外的任何内容都违反了XP的规则，正确的做法是等到这些内容上升为发布计划中最重要的故事时，才投入时间来实现它们。


<!-- Take your iteration deadlines seriously! Track your progress during an iteration. If it looks like you will not finish all of your tasks then call another iteration planning meeting, re-estimate,  and  remove  some   of  the   tasks. -->

严肃对待每个迭代的截止时间，并在迭代中跟踪任务的执行情况。当意识到无法在迭代内完成所有任务时，就召开一次新的[迭代计划会议](iteration-plan.md)，重新评估并移除部分任务。


<!-- Concentrate your effort on completing the most important tasks as chosen by your customer, instead of having several unfinished tasks chosen by the developers. -->

集中精力于那些由客户指定的最重要的任务，而不是开发人员自行选择的任务。


<!-- It may seem silly if your iterations are only one week long to make a new plan, but it pays off in the end. By planning out each iteration as if it was your last you will be setting yourself up for an on-time delivery of your product. Keep your projects heart beating loud and clear. -->

将所有迭代的长度都设置为1周，看起来似乎有些愚蠢，但最终都会有所回报。像应对最后期限一样计划每一次迭代，能够让你为产品的准时交付做好充足的准备。保持项目的心跳清晰而响亮！
