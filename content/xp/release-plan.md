# 发布计划

<!-- After user stories have been written you can use a release planning meeting to create a release plan. The release plan specifies which user stories are going to be implemented for each system release and dates for those releases. This gives a set of user stories for customers to choose from during the iteration planning meeting to be implemented during the next iteration. These selected stories are then translated into individual programming tasks to be implemented during the iteration to complete the stories. -->
用户故事编写完成后，即可通过[发布计划会议](release-planning.md)来制订发布计划。发布计划指定了每一次系统发布所需实现的用户故事，以及发布的具体时间。发布计划提供了一组用户故事供客户在[迭代计划会议](iteration-plan.md)中进行选择，以便在下一个迭代中实现。这些被选定的故事，会被分解为独立的开发任务，并在迭代期间完成。

<!-- Stories are also translated into acceptance tests during the iteration. These acceptance tests are run during this iteration, and subsequent iterations to verify when the stories are finished correctly and continue to work correctly. -->
用户故事会在迭代中被转换为[验收测试](acceptance-test.md)，这些测试会用来验证当前以及后继所有迭代中的故事是否被正确实现，并持续保持其可用状态。

<!-- When the project velocity changes dramatically for a couple iterations or in any case after several iterations go ahead and schedule a release planning meeting with your customers and create a new release plan. -->
如果两次迭代的[团队速率](velocity.md)波动较大，或已完成许多个迭代，那么应该是时候同客户一起重新安排发布计划会议并制定新的发布计划。

<!-- The release plan used to be called the commitment schedule. The name was changed to more accurately describe its purpose and be more consistent with iteration plan. -->
以前发布计划也叫承诺计划，改名后可以更准确的描述其意图，并且与迭代计划更加一致。
