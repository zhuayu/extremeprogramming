# 每日站会

<!-- At a typical project meeting most attendees do not contribute, but attend just to hear the outcome. A large amount of developer time is wasted to gain a trivial amount of communication. Having many people attend every meeting drains resources from the project and also creates a scheduling nightmare. -->

在传统的项目会议上，大多数参会者只是为了听取结果，并不打算做出贡献。开发人员在这些会议上浪费了大量时间，真正有效的沟通却微乎其微。让很多人参与每次会议，这不仅浪费项目资源，安排会议时间也会变成噩梦。

<!-- Communication among the entire team is the purpose of the stand up meeting. A stand up meeting every morning is used to communicate problems, solutions, and promote team focus. Everyone stands up in a circle to avoid long discussions. It is more efficient to have one short meeting that every one is required to attend than many meetings with a few developers each. -->

每日站会的目的是促进整个团队之间的沟通。每天早上的站会用于沟通问题和解决方案，促使团队聚焦。所有团队成员站成一圈，以避免长时间的讨论。所有人都参加的一次简短会议，比少数开发人员各自举行的多次会议更有效率。

<!-- When you have daily stand up meetings any other meeting's attendance can be based on who will actually be needed and will contribute. Now it is possible to avoid even scheduling most meetings. With limited attendance most meetings can take place spontaneously in front of a computer, where code can be browsed and ideas actually tried out. -->

有了每日站会之后，其他会议就可以只邀请实际需要的人员参加。甚至大多数会议可以完全不用刻意安排：由于参加人数有限，大多数会议都可以在电脑前自发进行，两三个人可以一边浏览代码、一边实际尝试想法。

<!-- During a stand up meeting developers report at least three things; what was accomplished yesterday, what will be attempted today, and what problems are causing delays. The daily stand up meeting is not another meeting to waste people's time. It will replace many other meetings giving a net savings several times its own length. -->

在一次站会期间，开发人员至少报告三件事：昨天完成了什么，今天将尝试什么，以及导致延误的问题。每日站会不是浪费时间的会议。它将取代许多其他会议，节省大量的会议时间。
