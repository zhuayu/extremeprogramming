# 结对编程

[comment]: <原文> (All code to be sent into production is created by two people working together at a single computer.)

所有代码，都由两个人、共用一台电脑共同完成。

[comment]: <原文> (Pair programming increases software quality without impacting time to deliver. It is counter intuitive, but 2 people working at a single computer will add as much functionality as two working separately except that it will be much higher in quality. With increased quality comes big savings later in the project.)

结对编程可以提高软件质量，而且还不会影响交付进度。这有些违反直觉。不过，两人共用一台电脑进行开发，和两人单独开发相比，交付的功能是一样多的，而且还能有更高的代码质量。而高质量的代码将在项目后续过程中节省大量的工作。

[comment]: <原文> (The best way to pair program is to just sit side by side in front of the monitor. Slide the key board and mouse back and forth. Both programmers concentrate on the code being written.)

结对编程的最佳方式，就是两人并肩坐在显示器前。谁在做操作的那一刻，就把键盘和鼠标拖到谁的面前。两个人都全神贯注于正在编写的代码。操作权的转换每隔几分钟就会发生一次。


[comment]: <原文> (Pair programming is a social skill that takes time to learn. You are striving for a cooperative way to work that includes give and take from both partners regardless of corporate status. The best pair programmers know when to say "let's try your idea first." Don't expect people to be good at it from the start. It helps if you have someone on your team with experience to show everyone what it should feel like.)

结对编程是一项社交技巧，需要花时间进行学习。你得努力找到一个合适的协作方法，这需要双方的付出。最优秀的结对程序员，知道在何时该说：“先试试你的办法吧”。别指望人们一开始就能精于此道。如果你的团队中有人有结对编程的经验，那么请他/她向所有人演示一下，让大家能有个直观的感受，这会帮助其他人更好地理解结对编程。


[comment]: <原文> (One thing pair programming is not is mentoring. A teacher-stundent relationship feels very different from two people working together as equals even if one has significantly more experience.)

需要注意的是，结对编程不是编程教学。即使二人的水平有很大差异，结对编程也要讲究两个人平等协作，这和“师生关系”的感觉是截然不同的。

[comment]: <原文> (It takes time to get used to pair programming so don't worry if it feels awkward at first.)

习惯结对编程需要时间，即使一开始觉得不自在，也不用担心，大家都是这么过来的。
